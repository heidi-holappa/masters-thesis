| 16.05. | 11 | 222 |  Worked on #11 and #15. Felt like I made very little progress, but now I now the basics of Ghidra and got a glimpse of IDA-free. And now I have RISC-V binaries with debug information.  |
| 17.05. |  6  | 228 | Re-read Foik et. al., spent rest of the day learning more on debugging tools and especially on DWARF  |
| 18.05. |  6 |  234 | Re-read PinTools introduction. Worked on #11. Finally understood the basic idea behind HybridVerifier! Worked on identifying what information to extract from DWARF and how.   |
| 19.05. |  11 | 245 | Worked on #11. Took a look at available tools and tested them out. Made progress.  |
| 20.05. |  11 | 256 | Worked on #11 and #18. Cool cumulative sum for today.  |
| 21.05. | 10  | 266 | Worked on #18. Made an initial working script with pyelftools. Needs still refining.  |
| 22.05. | 11 | 277 | Worked mostly on #18 and #19 |
| 23.05. | 2  | 279 | Took a day off, but re-read the papers on DWARF introduction and HybridVerifier again.     |
| 24.05. | 4  | 283 | Re-read the DWARF introduction twice and some sections of DWARF5 manual. Reed most of RV32 ABI specification |

| 26.05. | 1  | 287 | Wrote more to the introduction. Otherwise day off.   |
| 27.05. | 10  | 297  | Tried to understand InstructionSpecificCallbackAddress. Implemented instruction specific functionality to ISAExtensionValidator |
| 28.05. | 11 |  308 | Built a new plugin CJRTracer, built first part of the Python pipeline. Got some interesting results  |
| 29.05. | 7  |  315 | Improved pipeline, added support for multiple instructions. Thought a lot about memory accesses. Tough task.  |
| 30.05. | 11 |  326 | Worked on the Python pipeline, wrote more to the thesis  |

| 03.06. | 11 | 359 | Re-did the Python pipeline, got bummed when verification crashed, fixed it with new constrains, added support for frame pointer to extract dynamically positioned values from stack   |
| 04.06. | 10 | 369 | Continued on the python pipeline, verification works on some cases. Looked into array ranges  |
| 05.06. | 8  | 377 | Struggled with the verification stage of the pipeline, added support for arrays. Thought about return value comparison   |

| 11.06. | 9  | 427  | Spent the day refactoring extracted Dwarf info structure to enable recursive verification of subprograms. Quite an ordeal!  |
| 12.06. | 11 | 438  | Continued refactoring and got the recursive function verification to work! Began implementing new base types for verification.  |
| 13.06. | 9  | 447 |  Worked on implementing verification for larger set of return value types. All basic types are now implemented. |

| 15.06. | 6  | 458 | Learned more on structs and began implementing a solution. Ran into problems. Stared at the screen for a couple of hours just thinking. Came up with a couple of solutions, but none ideal. Need to stare some more at my screen. Or go for a long walk to think about this all. |
